          <p style="color: green;" class="mt-3"> The Colosseum, also known as the Flavian Amphitheatre, is a large artefact or structure in the city of Rome. 
             The construction of the Colosseum started around 70–72 AD and was finished in 80 AD.
             Emperor Vespasian started all the work, and Emperor Titus completed the colosseum. 
             Emperor Domitian made some changes to the building between 81–96 AD.[1] It had seating for 50,000 people.[2] It was 156 metres (512 ft) wide, 189 metres 
             (620 ft) long and 57 metres (187 ft) tall.
             It is the biggest amphitheatre built by the Roman Empire.  
             The Colosseum is in Rome, the capital of Italy. More precisely, it is on the east bank of the Tiber, the river that crosses the city, 
             east of the ancient Roman forum. A forum in antiquity was a geographical area in which were the main buildings of power, as well as the large square on which the population met.
             It was both a busy place to live, a place to get married, big parties, community meetings, and so on. The stadium was less than a kilometer to the southwest, the Capitol was a little over a mile to the west.
             Colosseum was first called the Flavian Amphitheatre or in Latin, the Amphitheatrum Flavium. This was after Vespasian and Titus who had the family name of Flavius.
             It was used for gladiatorial contests, and other shows like animal hunts, in which animals would hunt and eat prisoners; or in which gladiators would fight against animals.
             There were also executions of prisoners, plays, and battle scenes; sometimes it was filled with water to fight sea battles. The people of Rome could go into the Colosseum without any costs; it was free.
             n the Middle Ages, after the mid-fifth century, it was no longer used for performances. It was then used as housing, workshops, a Christian shrine, and as a supply of building stones. It is now in ruins because of earthquakes. 
             The Colosseum is a symbol of the Roman Empire. It is one of Rome's most popular tourist attractions. On Good Fridays, the Pope leads a torch lit "Way of the Cross" procession around the various levels of the amphitheatre.
